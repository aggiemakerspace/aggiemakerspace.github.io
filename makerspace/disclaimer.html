                                    In consideration for receiving permission to participate in the COE Makerspace (hereinafter
                                    referred to as COE Makerspace or a workshop) I hereby release, waive, discharge, and covenant
                                    not to sue COE Makerspace, its agents, servants, or employees (hereinafter referred to as “the
                                    released”) from any and all liability, claims, demands, actions and causes of action whatsoever
                                    arising out of or related to any loss, damage, or injury, including death, that may be sustained by
                                    me, or any of the property belonging to me, whether caused by the negligence of the released;
                                    while participating in such activity; or while in, on, or upon the premises where the activity is
                                    being conducted.
                                    I am fully aware of the unusual risks involved and hazards connected with activities and
                                    materials used in the COE Makerspace. I hereby elect to voluntarily participate in said activity
                                    with full knowledge that said activity may be hazardous to me and my property. I voluntarily
                                    assume full responsibility for any risks of loss, property damage or personal injury, including
                                    death, that may be sustained by me, or any loss or damage of property owned by me, as a result
                                    of being engaged in such activity, whether caused by the negligence of the released or otherwise.
                                    I further hereby agree to indemnify and hold harmless the released from any loss, liability,
                                    damage or costs, including court costs and attorney fees, that they may incur due to my
                                    participation in said activity, whether caused by negligence of released or otherwise.
                                    It is my express intent that this Waiver of Liability and Hold-Harmless Agreement shall bind the
                                    users of my family and spouse, if I am alive, and my heirs, assigns and personal representative, if

                                    agreement, have been made; I am fully competent; and I execute this release for full, adequate
                                    and complete consideration fully intending to be bound by same.
                                    If any of the provisions of this Agreement are found to be unenforceable, the remainder shall be
                                    enforced as fully as possible and the unenforceable provision(s) shall be deemed modified to the
                                    limited extent required to permit enforcement of the Agreement as a whole
                                    <h4>Confidentiality Agreement</h4>
                                    It is understood and agreed that COE Makerspace and all users and subcontractors thereof
                                    (hereby known as “the disclosure”), might disclose certain information that is and must be kept
                                    confidential. To ensure the protection of such information, and to preserve any confidentiality
                                    necessary under patent and/or trade secret laws, it is agreed that:
                                    1. Confidential Information is described as and includes, but is not limited to:
                                    Invention description(s), technical and business information relating to proprietary ideas and
                                    inventions, ideas, patentable ideas, trade secrets, drawings and/or illustrations, existing and/or
                                    contemplated products and services, research and development, production, costs, profit and
                                    margin information, finances and financial projections, customers, clients, marketing, and
                                    current or future business plans and models, regardless of whether such information is designated
                                    as “Confidential Information” at the time of its disclosure.
                                    2. The Recipient agrees not to disclose any Confidential Information obtained from the
                                    disclosure to anyone unless required to do so by law.

                                    3. This Agreement states the entire agreement between the parties concerning the disclosure of
                                    Confidential Information. Any addition or modification to this Agreement must be made in
                                    writing and signed by the parties.
                                    4. If any of the provisions of this Agreement are found to be unenforceable, the remainder shall
                                    be enforced as fully as possible and the unenforceable provision(s) shall be deemed modified to
                                    the limited extent required to permit enforcement of the Agreement as a whole.
                                    The parties acknowledge that they have read and understand this Agreement and voluntarily
                                    accept the duties and obligations set forth herein.
